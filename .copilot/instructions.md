# Copilot Implementation Guidance

This repository follows a spec-first approach (see docs/spec.md). When generating code:

1. Favor pure functions in tools (no side effects).
2. All MCP tool outputs must contain `schema_version`.
3. Keep tool implementations in `src/sim_racecenter_agent/mcp/tools/`.
4. Do not perform JetStream pulls inside tool handlersâ€”use cached state.
5. Use pydantic models for:
   - Settings
   - Tool inputs/outputs
   - Internal domain models (incidents, snapshot)
6. Add logging for each tool call: logger name `tool.<name>`.
7. Expand tests incrementally:
   - Start with state_cache behavior
   - Then tool response shapes
8. Provide type hints everywhere; pass mypy (strict) if feasible.
9. Stage future work behind TODO markers referencing spec sections.

If unsure about structure, read docs/spec.md (source of truth).
